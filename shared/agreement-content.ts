The Company does not reimburse the Contractor for any Contractor Equipment costs.</p><p><strong>Business Investment: </strong>The Contractor acknowledges that the requirement to invest in Contractor Equipment is consistent with the Contractor's status as an independent business operator and distinguishes this relationship from an employment relationship where tools are typically provided by the employer.</p><h1><strong>ARTICLE 4 - COMPENSATION AND PAYMENT</strong></h1><h2><strong>4.1 Compensation Structure</strong></h2><p>In consideration of the Services provided by the Contractor, the Company shall pay the Contractor as follows:</p><ol><li><strong>Revenue Share: </strong>The Contractor shall receive fifty percent (50%) of the Gross Revenue received by the Company from the Delivery Partner for Services performed by the Contractor or the Contractor's Approved Substitutes (the "Contractor Share").

Failure to dispute a payment within this period shall constitute acceptance of the payment as correct and a waiver of any claims related to such payment.</li></ol><h2><strong>4.3 Performance Bonus</strong></h2><p>The Contractor may be eligible for performance bonuses based on the Contractor's Driver Score. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, award bonuses to Contractors who consistently achieve excellent Driver Scores.

The Contractor understands that a criminal record may disqualify the Contractor from providing Services, at the sole discretion of the Company.</p><h1><strong>ARTICLE 9 - CONFIDENTIALITY</strong></h1><h2><strong>9.1 Confidentiality Obligations</strong></h2><p>The Contractor acknowledges that in the course of providing the Services, the Contractor may have access to Confidential Information. The Contractor agrees:</p><ol><li>to hold all Confidential Information in strict confidence and not to disclose any Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the Company;</li><li>to use Confidential Information only for the purpose of performing the Services and not for any personal benefit or the benefit of any third party;</li><li>to protect Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care that the Contractor uses to protect the Contractor's own confidential information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care;</li><li>not to photograph, copy, or reproduce any Confidential Information except as necessary for the performance of the Services;</li><li>to immediately return or destroy all Confidential Information upon termination of this Agreement or upon request by the Company;</li><li>to ensure that all Approved Substitutes are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth herein.</li></ol><h2><strong>9.2 Customer Information</strong></h2><p>Without limiting the generality of Section 9.1, the Contractor specifically acknowledges that customer names, addresses, telephone numbers, delivery preferences, and any other customer information are Confidential Information.

The Contractor further acknowledges that the Contractor has had the opportunity to seek independent legal advice regarding this Agreement and these restrictions.</p><h2><strong>10.4 Injunctive Relief</strong></h2><p>The Contractor acknowledges that a breach of the covenants contained in this Article 10 would cause irreparable harm to the Company for which monetary damages would be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, the Contractor agrees that the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief to prevent or restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Article 10, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bond or security.</p><h1><strong>ARTICLE 11 - INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</strong></h1><h2><strong>11.1 Indemnification by Contractor</strong></h2><p><strong>THE CONTRACTOR SHALL INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD HARMLESS THE COMPANY, ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND AFFILIATES </strong>(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Damages arising out of, relating to, or resulting from:</p><ol><li>the Contractor's (or any Approved Substitute's) performance or failure to perform the Services;</li><li>the Contractor's (or any Approved Substitute's) negligence, recklessness, or intentional misconduct;</li><li>any breach by the Contractor of this Agreement or the Vehicle Lease Agreement;</li><li>any violation by the Contractor (or any Approved Substitute) of any applicable law, regulation, or rule;</li><li>any claim that the Contractor is an employee of the Company rather than an independent contractor;</li><li>any claim related to the Contractor's failure to pay taxes, including any claim by the Canada Revenue Agency or any provincial tax authority;</li><li>any Incident involving the Leased Vehicle;</li><li>any claim by any Approved Substitute against the Company;</li><li>any claim by any third party arising out of the Contractor's or any Approved Substitute's conduct.</li></ol><h2><strong>11.2 Defense of Claims</strong></h2><p>The Company shall have the right, at its option, to assume the defense of any claim subject to indemnification under this Article 11, with counsel of the Company's choosing.

Either Party may decline to renew the Agreement for any reason or no reason. If the Parties agree to renew, they shall execute a written renewal agreement or amendment.
